Overview of the Weather Feature Solution for the National Trust Website

As part of an effort to enhance the user experience and provide valuable information to potential visitors, I have developed a solution to display weather information on the National Trust property pages. This feature aims to help users make informed decisions about visiting a property based on the current and forecasted weather conditions.

The solution integrates weather data from a reliable weather API, ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information is presented to users. When a user visits a property page on the National Trust website, the solution automatically retrieves the relevant weather data for that specific location.

The weather information is prominently displayed on the property page, making it easily accessible to users. The current weather conditions, including temperature and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), are presented in a clear and visually appealing format. Additionally, a 5-day forecast is provided, giving users an overview of the expected weather for the upcoming days.

To ensure a seamless user experience, the weather feature is designed to blend in with the existing layout and style of the National Trust website. The information is presented in a concise and easy-to-read manner, using fonts and colours that align with the overall brand guidelines.

In the event that the weather data cannot be retrieved due to technical issues or API limitations, a fallback mechanism is in place. Instead of displaying outdated or incomplete information, the solution presents a friendly message to users, acknowledging the temporary unavailability of the weather data. A link to an alternative weather source, such as the BBC Weather website, is provided to ensure that users can still access weather information if needed.

To gauge the effectiveness and impact of this weather feature, I propose conducting an A/B test. By comparing user engagement metrics, such as click-through rates and time spent on the page, between a control group (without the weather feature) and a variant group (with the weather feature), we can determine whether the addition of weather information influences user behaviour and the likelihood of visiting a property.

The A/B test will also take into account the potential impact of different weather conditions on user behaviour. By analysing the metrics on days with favourable and unfavourable weather conditions, we can assess whether the weather feature encourages visits during good weather and provides valuable information for users to plan their visits accordingly during less ideal weather conditions.

Overall, this solution aims to provide National Trust website users with relevant and timely weather information, enhancing their experience and assisting them in making informed decisions about visiting properties. Through the implementation of this feature and the insights gained from A/B testing, we strive to create a more engaging and user-centric experience for National Trust visitors.
