# National Trust Weather Feature

## Overview
The National Trust Weather Feature is a solution developed to enhance the user experience on the National Trust website by displaying weather information on property pages. This feature aims to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather data, helping them make informed decisions about visiting a property based on the current and forecasted weather conditions.

## Problem Statement
The National Trust seeks to improve user engagement and increase the likelihood of users visiting their properties. By providing relevant weather information directly on the property pages, the National Trust aims to assist users in planning their visits and enhance their overall experience.

## Solution
The solution integrates weather data from a reliable weather API to display current and forecasted weather information on the National Trust property pages. The key components of the solution include:

- Retrieving weather data: The solution fetches weather data from the API based on the location of each property. It extracts relevant information such as temperature, weather description, and a 5-day forecast.

- Displaying weather information: The weather data is prominently displayed on the property page, using a clear and visually appealing format that aligns with the National Trust's brand guidelines. The current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast are presented to users.

- Fallback mechanism: In case of technical issues or API limitations, a fallback mechanism is implemented to handle situations where weather data cannot be retrieved. A user-friendly message is displayed, acknowledging the temporary unavailability of the data, and a link to an alternative weather source (e.g., BBC Weather) is provided.

- A/B testing: To measure the impact of the weather feature on user engagement and the likelihood of visiting a property, an A/B test is proposed. The test compares user behavior between a control group (without the weather feature) and a variant group (with the weather feature), considering factors such as click-through rates, time spent on the page, and the influence of different weather conditions.

## Implementation Details
The solution is implemented using JavaScript and integrates seamlessly with the existing National Trust website. The key steps involved in the implementation are:

1. Retrieving the property location from the Google Maps URL present on the property page.
2. Constructing the weather API URL using the property location and the provided API key.
3. Fetching weather data from the API using the `fetch` function and handling the response.
4. Parsing the weather data and extracting relevant information such as temperature, weather description, and forecast.
5. Creating HTML elements to display the weather information on the property page.
6. Implementing a fallback mechanism to handle cases where weather data cannot be retrieved, displaying a user-friendly message and a link to an alternative weather source.
7. Applying styling to the weather elements to ensure visual consistency with the National Trust website's design.
8. Setting up A/B testing to measure the impact of the weather feature on user engagement and the likelihood of visiting a property.

## Conclusion
The National Trust Weather Feature solution aims to provide users with valuable weather information directly on the property pages, enhancing their experience and assisting them in making informed decisions about visiting a property. By conducting an A/B test, the National Trust can measure the effectiveness of the feature and gain insights into its impact on user behavior. The solution is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and aligned with the National Trust's brand guidelines.

## Next Steps
- Conduct the A/B test to gather data on the impact of the weather feature on user engagement and the likelihood of visiting a property.
- Analyse the A/B test results and make data-driven decisions on whether to implement the weather feature permanently or iterate on the solution based on user feedback and behaviour.
- Continuously monitor and optimise the performance of the weather feature to ensure it provides a positive user experience and meets the National Trust's goals.
